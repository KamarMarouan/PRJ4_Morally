  Justification Page
	<p> This page is for justifying our choices regarding the design of our website. </p>

</div>




<div class = "Justification3"> 
	COLOR
	</div>
	<div class = "Justification4">
		Throughout the whole website, we use the same colours that we think fit well with our brand: they are calm, noticeable and we think that they invite people to stay on our website. During the prototyping phase, we got compliments for the colours, people seemed to like them a lot. The use of different colours did not seem too distracting, which is why we kept them in.  
	</div>
		
<div class="Justification3"> HOME PAGE
	</div>
	<div class = "Justification4">
	We want to be a personal brand that offers services to help people in their professional career, but also combining this with help for their personal growth. Therefore, we chose to make it clear on our home page what our services are and what we can help with, but also showing our brand values and mission immediately so people know that we offer personal help. 
	The results from our prototype usability testing were that the services were not yet visible enough, and our testers did think this was important. Following this feedback, we made the services more visible. This is why they are present on the home page immediately, but we also made a button for services, so visitors of the website can gain more insights. 
		We also included pictures of our team, because as said before, we think of our brand as personal. Possible customers can now see a face that will help them, which we think makes it more interesting and inviting to book a membership for our services and help. They will know who will help them and who they will talk to. 
	Experiences of other people are also seen on the home page, because we think this can convince people to book a membership. It is not extremely present, as you can click on the arrow and view different experiences. This way, visitors of the website can decide for themselves if they want to read the experiences. 
	  </div>
<div class="Justification3"> ABOUT US PAGE
	  </div>
	  <div class = "Justification4">
		  The "About us" page shows our mission and values, because we think it is important for our (possible) members to know what kind of brand we are and what we stand for. In this way, they can identify themselves with us and be more invested in our brand or in thinking of booking a membership. 
	  </div>
	 
	<div class="Justification3"> SERVICES
	  </div>
	  <div class = "Justification4">
		  On our home page, it can already be found what kind of services we offer. However, we wanted to include a page that is more detailed in what we are offering with our services, so possible customers already have more insights. This page's purpose is mainly giving information about what we offer as a brand. This way, they will know more what they can expect. 
	  </div>
	
<div class="Justification3"> WHO WE HELPED
	</div>
<div class = "Justification4">
	As we want to help our clients, we want to give them an impression on what they can expect from our services. We think testimonials and positive experiences make it most clear what can be expected.
	  </div>
	
<div class="Justification3"> BOOK MEMBERSHIP
</div>
<div class = "Justification4">
On our website, we have made it easy for potential customers to book a membership, by having a direct option of booking it. This way, people do not have to search the whole website, but they directly know where to go if they want to book a membership.
